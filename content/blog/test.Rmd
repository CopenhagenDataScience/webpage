description: "This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash          command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I'll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can       organize your templates to create a theme. I won't cover using CSS to style your theme.
    
    We'll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we'll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on      that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites."

## Introduction

It was crucial to me that this webpage should be easy to keep up to date and that fokes who master markdown should be able to submit new posts without needing to take up html.
