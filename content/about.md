# Who we are
We are a group of students at the Faculty of Social Sciences UCPH with ties to the academic staff at the Department of Economics. Our main goal is to learn how computer science can broaden and improve the social sciences and at the same time share this endeavour with anyone who wish to join. As much as we enjoy research we're not blind to the applications of e.g. machine learning in the economy at large, and recognize that much of the development in data driven analysis has it's most important applications in government and industry.

# What we do
We arrange events with technical and creative content, such as hackathons, seminars etc. to learn and teach the ideas and techniques of what has become known as _social data science_. We also meet to discuss tools and ideas applicable in our work, and develop research questions, sometimes without ever pursuing them. Beyond that we do whatever we want, in a world where a few lines of code and a good idea is all it takes to make it.

# Get in touch
Do you want to join? Hit us up through our [github organization](http://www.github.com). If you think what we're doing is interesting but don't quite know your way around the mechanics of the digital age, get in touch and we'll show you the ropes.
